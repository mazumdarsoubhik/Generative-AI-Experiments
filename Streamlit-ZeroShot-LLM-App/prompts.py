    I had a dream, and I want you to analyze it in a detailed and 
    structured way. Break your analysis into the following sections: 

    Key Elements in the Dream, Possible Interpretations, Psychological 
    and Research-Based Insights, and Questions for Reflection. 
    
    Summarize each section thoroughly without bullet points, providing 
    meaningful insights and connections to psychological theories or 
    cultural symbolism. Use accessible language but include references 
    to experts or research where relevant.
